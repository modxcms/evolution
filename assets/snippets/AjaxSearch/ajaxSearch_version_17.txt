ajaxSearch is working pretty good for me but I have some problem with the Extract 
function which seems to extract far too much content. Not only that, but it extracts 
content with the original formatting and line breaks which makes for very long and 
confusing results layout. Is there any way to exert some control over these results 
and perhaps strip out the formatting and line breaks? Thanks

If your database charset and your pages are all in UTF-8, normally you do not 
use the phb.mbstring extension, but ...

Corrected with 1.6.2b fix

My $database_connection_charset variable was not set. 
The interesting thing is that it was not set on my home machine either and it worked.

Corrected with 1.6.2c fix

I just noticed that it fails if I do a search while logged in as a web user.
Not logged in, everything works, but when logged in as any web user, I get the 
following javascript error: "The URI to be decoded is not a valid encoding"

Corrected with 1.6.2d
