// Outstanding Bugs: 2	(Bug 1, 3a)

// Fixes: 1 ($paramaters)
// Outstanding Bugs: 1 (#9)
// Comments: I didn't know if #9 was really a "bug", or just a way to extend the script's capabilities. Also, need to check to see if the $paramaters mispelling causes issues (i..e, still be refrenced the "old" way in some parts of the script).

// Fixes: 2
// Comments: Added a // comment for the filetype fix, so people know it's a IE6-specific issue, & added a // comment for the extra .jpg filetype fix, so people would understand it's just adding the ability for WLPE to "accept" the alternate filetype. Since they all use the same function, I combined them together.

// I'm too lazy to list all of the changes here, but the bugs I created trying to fix earlier reported bugs has been incorporated.
// vhollo's fix for image resizing was also applied. As for the pagenation hack, that's on the backburner for a v1.3.2 release, since there's been some minor issues with it.
