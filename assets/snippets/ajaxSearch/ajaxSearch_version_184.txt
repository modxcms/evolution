==================== NEW OPTIONS / CHANGES (since 1.8.1) =======================

==== Adding the number of the result - AJAXSEARCH-34

    [+as.resultNumber+] placeholder available to display the number of the search result
    Use this placeholder inside your result.tpl.html or ajaxResult.tpl.html template

==== LiveSearch

    - ajaxSearchType parameter replaced by liveSearch. e.g: &liveSearch=`1`
    Now the search starts only when the minimum character is reached


==== Initialisation of configuration parameters is modified

    To limit the number of javascript variables, now the default parameters are
    stored in the default.config.inc.php file. This file is read by the
    ajaxSearch class and by the ajaxSearchPopup class.
    The only parameters transmitted by JavaScript to the ajaxSearchPopup class are:
    - the subSearch and the advSearch parameters
    - the parameters used in the snippet call


==== Mootools (1.11 or 1.2.1) or Jquery js library  - AJAXSEARCH-2

    &jscript ['jquery' | 'mootools1.2' | 'mootools']
    Set this to jquery if you would like to include the jquery library
    set this to mootools1.2 to include the mootools 1.2.1 library (limited to JS functions used by AS)
    by default: mootools. This default include the mootools library provided by MODx

    e.g: &jscript=`jquery` or &jscript=`mootools1.2`


==== Capturing failed search criteria and search logs - AJAXSEARCH-3

    &asLog - ajaxSearch log [ level [: comment [: purge]]]

    level:
      0 : disallow the ajaxSearch log (default)
      1 : failed search requests are logged
      2 : all ajaxSearch requests are logged

    comment:
      0 : user comment not allowed (default)
      1 : user comment allowed

    purge: number of logs allowed before to do an automatic purge of the table
      0 : no purge allowed (= illimited number of logs)
          default: 200

      &asLog=`x` is equivalent to &asLog=`x:0:200`
      &asLog=`x:y` is equivalent to &asLog=`x:y:200`

      &asLog=`1:1:500` means that 500 failed search requests possibly commented
                       by the end user could be stored in the ajaxSearch_log table


    &tplComment : chunk to style comment form
        by default: @FILE:".AS_SPATH.'templates/comment.tpl.html'

    The comment form is protected from spamming by the use of a hidden input field.
    (idea suggested from SPForm by Bob Ray ) This field should be hidden by the
    CSS styling. If it's filled in (presumably by spammer autobots) nothing is sent.
    The "hidden" content is not really hidden, just not visible, so no worries
    about being penalized by Google. Visually challenged users of
    text-only browsers or audio browsers MAY see the input field and fill it
    (although the text warns them not to).

    You need to paste the following code into your CSS file. Otherwise
    the field will not be hidden.

    .ajaxSearch_hiddenField {
      position:absolute;
      text-decoration:underline;
      background-color:#CC0000;
      left:0px;
      top:-500px;
      width:1px;
      height:1px;
      overflow:hidden;
    }

    Keep spammers from pasting too many links into the comment and sending it
   (counts "http" instances); A maximum of 2 links per comment is allowed otherwise
    the comment is rejected.
    You could adjust this value in the file classes/ajaxSearchLog.class.inc by
    changing the CMT_MAX_LINKS definition.

    The maximum length of the comment is of 100 characters. Otherwise the comment
    is rejected. Helps short-circuit injection attacks.
    You could this value in the file classes/ajaxSearchLog.class.inc by
    changing the CMT_MAX_LENGTH definition.

    The user searches are stored in the database table $modx_table_prefix."ajaxsearch_log"
    These data are not for the end user only for the site administrator.

    Informations stored per each search are the following:

      id : internal id of the search request looged
      searchstring : the search terms used for the search
      nb_results : number of results found
      results : document ids found
      comment : comment leave by the user regarding the search results
      as_call : ajaxSearch snippet call used
      as_select : select statement used (could be reused thru phpmyadmin)
      date : date and hour of the request
      ip : user IP

    The table could be drop without any impacts on the AjaxSearch behaviour. Simply,
    if the asLog parameter is set and the table inexisting, the table is rebuilt.

    A 'Did you find what you are looking for?' form is available for the user
    when the option comment is set. In this case the user could leave a comment
    about the search results.
    &tplComment parameter define which form template used.

    A module will be provided later to manage these search datas.
    We could imagine the following features:
    - drop the table
    - delete (successfull, unsuccessfull, all) searches executed before a specific date
    - delete (successfull, unsuccessfull, all) searches executed before N days
    - give me as meta tag keywords, the N most used (successfull, unsuccessfull) search terms
    - replay a specific search with a new debug level
    - delete uncommented (successfull, unsuccessfull, all) searches
    - filter view with commented (successfull, unsuccessfull, all) searches

    See the Log search requests demo and the AjaxSearch 1.8.2 logs on the demo site


==== SearchString metacharacter available with &filter parameter - AJAXSEARCH-4

    The metacharacter '#' is replaced by the search string provided by the web user
    when used with the filter parameter. The advSearch parameter is also taken into account.

    e.g: &filter=`pagetitle,#,8` with searchString=`school child` and advSearch='oneword'
    is equivalent to &filter=`pagetitle,school,8|pagetitle,child,8`

    'oneword','allwords','nowords' generate as many clause as searchterms.
    'exactphrase' generate only one clause with the exactphrase as criterion.

    Multiple clauses have an "OR" relationship. I.e. a document will be excluded
    if it meets the criterion of any one clause (clause-1 OR clause-2 OR clause-3, etc.).
    (see http://ditto.modxcms.com/tutorials/basic_filtering.html)


==== Limit the amount of keywords that will be queried by a search - AJAXSEARCH-9

    &maxWords [int]
    Maximum number of words for searching - Default: 5


==== php_mbstring extension

    &mbstring [0 | 1]
      1 - mbstring extension available (default)
      0 - don't use php_mbstring extension

    The php_mbstring is supposed to be loaded.
    If html charset page is "UTF-8", php_mbstring extension should be loaded for language which
    need a multi-byte representation.
    If the extension is not available for the PHP server, some charset like ISO-8859-1 (latin1) could be used.
    With UTF-8, a message "Php_mbstring extension is required" when &mbstring=`1` and the extension not loaded.
    In this case load the extension or set the mbstring parameter to 0 if you couldn't load the extension


==== Always display paging - AJAXSEARCH-28

	  &showPagingAlways [1 | 0] (optional)

    always display paging. Even if you get only one page.
	  Set this to `1` if you would like to always show paging.

    Two use cases: You are using non-ajax search or when you are using ajax search but
    you have set up showMoreResults to `1` and you have defined moreResultsPage,
    then it may happen that ajax search result have only one page and pagination isn't showed
	  by default : 0


==== searchString available as placeholder

    Use [+as.searchString+] to get the search string used for the search.
    For instance use "Search results for [+as.searchString+]" as pagetitle for
    your landing page.


==== FirePhp extension library updated

    Update of FirePhp lib directory from 0.2.b.2 to 0.2.1 version
    See classes/FirePHPCore


==== searchHighlight and advSearchHighlight plugins 1.4

    Removed useless urldecode calls;
    Added check for magic quotes - if set, remove slashes
    Highlights terms searched for when target is a HTML entity
