Extract with a % percent character freeze the display of the results output
Unuseless usage of the decodeURIComponent function in js/ajaxSearch.js (line 162)


Correction of search with searchStyle = "relevance"
Do a full text search in pagetitle, description and content fields. Use LIKE for others fields
FULLTEXT indexes exists only for `pagetitle`,`description`,`content`
