MiniXML provides a simple API to generating and parsing XML with 2 implementations:
- a 100% PHP implementation
- a set of Pure Perl modules.

Either of the implementations may be used seperately.

MiniXML provides classes for XML documents and elements.

There is some example code in the docs directory but the full API, 
an overview and example code are all available on the official website at:

http://minixml.psychogenic.com

Also have a look in the ./doc directory, for a few examples of PHP (*.php) and 
Perl (*.pl)

Pat Deegan
