    <p><strong>ManagerManager 0.6.3</strong></p>
    <p>Customize the Evo Manager to offer bespoke admin functions for end users or manipulate the display of document fields in the manager.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You can put your ManagerManager rules EITHER in a chunk OR in an external file - whichever suits your development style the best.<br /><br />To use an external file, put your rules in /assets/plugins/managermanager/mm_rules.inc.php&nbsp; (you can rename default.mm_rules.inc.php and use it as an example).</p>
    <p>The chunk SHOULD have php opening tags at the beginning and end.<br /><br />If you want to put your rules in a chunk (so you can edit them through the Manager), create the chunk, and enter its name in the configuration tab. The chunk should NOT have php tags at the beginning or end.<br /><br />See also user-friendly module for editing ManagerManager configuration file ddMMEditor at <a href="http://code.divandesign.biz/modx/ddmmeditor">http://code.divandesign.biz/modx/ddmmeditor</a>.<br /><br />ManagerManager requires jQuery 1.9.1, which is located in /assets/plugins/managermanager/js/ folder.</p>
