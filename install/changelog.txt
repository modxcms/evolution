* [FS#344] and [FS#537] saveUserSettings function - removed $GLOBALS check which was causing problems when testing on my hosted server.
* [FS#344] and [FS#537] saveUserSettings function - changed to allow blank values to be saved, for example if we don't want the user to have any uploadable filetype permissions.
* [FS#344] and [FS#537] Added in additional resource browser settings to mirror those available in the main system config.
* [FS#344] and [FS#537] Manually extract user settings in mutate_user.dynamic.php so that the current user's language and theme settings aren't overridden.

* [FS#506] Redirect according to RFC 2616.
* [FS#90] In config settings, if GD isn't installed, you [now] can't choose "Yes" for captcha setting.

* [FS#531] QuickEdit trying to update wrong table with editedby and editedon data.
* [FS#454] Eliminate browser warning when Tree node is null in Tree Menu.

* [FS#431] Adds in two new system configuration settings: failed login count - max number of failed logins allowed before user is blocked, applied to both manager and web users; blocked minutes - length of time used to calculate the 'blocked until' date (I used minutes as it gives a good spread of time periods without getting into messy decimal values).

* [FS#344] Changed the bizarre logic in the saveUserSettings() function that was deleting all the user settings before adding the most recent change (resulting in all the other settings returning to the defaults). (1442)
* [FS#484] This fix hooks in the MODx configuration settings into the Resource Browser allowing the browser to respect the uploadable file types specified in the settings. Config settings have been separated out to account for the 4 possible states that the browser can be opened in (images, media, flash, and files). Added new language strings to english lang file and adjusted existing 'filetype' strings for clarification. (1442)
* Added fourth parameter to sendRedirect() function; this responseCode parameter can be used to pass in a valid HTTP redirect code to be set with a header() call (i.e. 'HTTP/1.1 301 Permanently moved'). (1440)
* Fixed paths in loadExtension so it does not produce the path with //manager (1440)
* Modified QuickEdit plugin to only execute if manager session is valid and to check if the Output class exists before calling include_once on it again.  Should save .02 to .1s per request when manager is not logged in. (1433)

* Updated the SLLists include for Doc Manager with full php tags. (1431)

* [FS#259] Amended language string that was referencing snippets, and not chunks. (1431)
* [FS#198] This fix uses a session value to allow the full manager to refresh when a theme is changed and prevents the manager being locked in an endless loop. (1431)

* [FS#255] Added $modx->sendForward($docId, $httpResponseCode) method and modified all sendErrorPage and sendUnauthorizedPage functionality to use the new method with the proper response code.  You can use this to forward a request without redirection, to any MODx document with any valid HTTP response code that is appropriate.

* Added Document Manager language files to Manager (1381)
* Updated Prototype/Scriptaculous to 1.6.4 (1379)

* Tweak to allow weblogin to work with image button types (fixes IE failure) (1354)
* [FS#300] Missing doctype and opening HTML tag on outer frameset. Also updated JS call (language="JavaScript" --> type="text/javascript") (1348)
* [FS#170] Implement logic to ensure all cache files are deleted with clear cache (1347)
* [FS#458] Alter config.inc.php file to use single-quotes for DB name to allow for special characters ($ in particular) without parsing in php (1342)
* Updated Wayfinder in core installation.
* Fix membercheck snippet so that it works under PHP 4.3 and above. (1324)

* Added category support to all resource views and changed Categories tab to 'Combined View'
* Updated AjaxSearch snippet to only search docs they have access to.  Updated install to include changes and added Search Highlighting plugin to the install.
* [FS#170] Read the bug report (http://modxcms.com/bugs/task/170) for details, but basically, this kills the need to refresh multiple times to wipe out ALL cache files.
* [FS#458] The config.inc.php file was being written with all database login credentials surrounded with double quote marks. This made it so PHP wanted to interpolate the $ as a variable name rather than a literal character. The fix is simply to use single quote strings for that information.
* [FS#321] as directory structures such as: 2006/08/01 can now be created with friendly paths enabled (should please the bloggers ;) )
* [FS#308] and [FS#476] Problem where pages could be referenced from fictitious directories when friendly alias paths are enabled and a document ID is used in the URL. For example, http://mysite.com/made-up-directory/8 will have returned document 8 even though that directory doesn't exist. The fix ties document IDs to the virtual directory structure when friendly alias paths are used preventing document IDs being referenced outside of their location in the structure.
* [FS#414] Raymond's multi-select TV fix for saving TV values on PHP5. (has worked in majority of cases, but also appears it can be caused by some server configs)

* Introducing a basic multiple file upload feature to filebrowser.

* [FS#280] Gives DBAPI object default connection values, but allows for others to override if specified - which is needed in some cases when connecting to a different db on the same server.
* Adds makeArray function to DBAPI so that you don't have to write the same stinkin' routine to array-ize a record set after each select statement result. Very handy. And works.
* Fixed form input fields for link_attributes and menutitle to be able to have double quotes.
* Patches for adding attributes to links
* Use a plain document ID as a weblink, and click on the Document Tree to set the ID you want.

* Improving the logic on getAffectedRows and getInsertID.(891)
* Added explicit call to $this->db->connect() in executeParser() function so when using mysql_real_escape_string() before any call to $this->db->query(), you would not get an error from the mysql_real_escape_sting function because no connection was available (888)
* Removing IE-specific contextual pop-up menu... now they all get the "Mozilla one" (881)
* [FS 195] Fixed a couple of warning notices. (879)
* Added support for mysql_real_escape_string for better multi-lingual support as per this request http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,3368.0.html, less the magic quotes fix because it might break things. (878)
